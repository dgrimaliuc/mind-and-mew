Here’s the npm install command to install all the mentioned libraries:

npm install react react-dom @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @mui/material @mui/icons-material @tanstack/react-query sass framer-motion lodash react-router-dom firebase

For ESLint and Prettier, you’ll need to install them as dev dependencies:

npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks

Explanation:
• react and react-dom: Core React libraries.
